            info: "Hauntbnb was my first full stack project at App Academy. It isn't much to look at, but due to being a school project there were limitations on creativity due to grading. The front end has limited functionality, but supports Log in, Sign up, Authentication, and full CRUD for Spots and Reviews. The front end was created in Vanilla React bundled with Vite using Vanilla Redux for the store. The back end of this project was built in Sequelize and is more robust. It supports all the functionality of the front end, as well as Bookings, and Queries This is the first full stack project I built in school. While I may not have had the creative freedom to build things the way I would like, it was my first taste of my future in development and I enjoyed the work. If you feel so inclined, I have included the link to the public GitHub for this project. Feel free to check out some of my first code, or spin it up yourself!",
